# BookSearchEngine

## Description
   The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books by title, author. It also allows users to add books to their personal library of books they have saved. 
   The user may also delete books from their saved books. Initially the book search engine was using a REST API  but, it has been refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo.
